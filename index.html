            <p>To be safe on the Internet, keep your social media profiles private so that strangers can't easily find your personal information online. 
                <br> When you shop online, make sure the website you're ordering from has a small lock icon in the URL field, <br> 
                which means it's secure and your info won't get stolen.</p>
