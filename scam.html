    <h1>What are scams?</h1>
    <p>Some scams are easy to spot, while others are so sneaky you may not know you have been scammed until itâ€™s too late. 

        Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
        
        Almost everyone will be the target of a scam at some time. You may have already been scammed.
        
        Most scams need you to do something before they can work.
        
        Scammers may get you to do any of the following: 
        
        send money based on false promises
        give out your personal details 
        agree to deals without getting advice
        buy a product without checking it properly.</p>

    <h1>Ten most common types of scams</h1> <br>
    <h1>Advance fee fraud</h1>
    <p> A scammer requests fees upfront or personal information in return for goods, services, money or rewards <br> 
        that they never supply. <br>

        Scammers invent convincing and seemingly genuine reasons for requesting payment, such as to cover fees or <br>
        taxes. <br>
        
        They often ask for payment by international wire transfer. <br>
        
        These scams are commonly mass-marketed with scammers sending them out to thousands of people all over <br>
         the world at the same time, usually by mail or email. </p>
