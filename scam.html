    <h1>What are scams?</h1>
    <p>Some scams are easy to spot, while others are so sneaky you may not know you have been scammed until <br> it’s too late. <br>
        <br>

        Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. <br>
        <br>
        
        Almost everyone will be the target of a scam at some time. You may have already been scammed. <br>
        <br>

        Most scams need you to do something before they can work. <br>
        <br>
        
        Scammers may get you to do any of the following: <br>
        <br>
        
        1.send money based on false promises <br>
        <br>
        2.give out your personal details <br>
        <br>
        3.agree to deals without getting advice <br>
        <br>
        4.buy a product without checking it properly. <br></p>

    <h1>Ten most common types of scams</h1> <br>
    <h1>1.Advance fee fraud</h1>
    <p> A scammer requests fees upfront or personal information in return for goods, services, money or rewards <br> 
        that they never supply. <br>
<br>
        Scammers invent convincing and seemingly genuine reasons for requesting payment, such as to cover fees or <br>
        taxes. <br>
        <br>
        They often ask for payment by international wire transfer. <br>
        
        These scams are commonly mass-marketed with scammers sending them out to thousands of people all over <br>
         the world at the same time, usually by mail or email. </p> 

         <br>
     
     <h1>2.Lottery, sweepstakes and competition scams</h1><br>   
    <p>An email, letter or text message from an overseas lottery or sweepstakes company arrives from out of <br>
        nowhere. <br>
<br>
        It says you have won a lot of money or fantastic prizes in a lottery or sweepstakes competition you did not <br>
        enter. <br>
        <br>
        These scams try to trick you into giving money upfront or your personal details in order to receive the prize. <br>
        <br>
        Scammers typically claim that you need to pay fees or taxes before your winnings or prize can be released. <br>
        <br>
        
        You may also have to call or text a premium rate phone number to claim your prize. <br>
        <br>
        
        Remember you cannot win a prize if you haven’t entered.</p><br>
        <br>

        <h1>3.Computer hacking</h1>
        <p>Phishing emails are commonly used by scammers to trick you into giving them access to your computer. <br>
            <br>

            They ‘fish’ for your personal details by encouraging you to click on a link or attachment. <br>
            <br>
            
            If you click, malicious software will be installed and the hacker will have access to files and information 
            <br> stored on your computer. <br>
            <br>
            
            A phishing email often appears to come from an organisation that you know and trust, like a bank or financial <br> institution, asking you to enter your account password on a fake copy of the site’s login page. <br>
            <br>
            
            If you provide your account details, the scammer can hack into your account and take control of your profile.</p>
