    <h1>What are scams?</h1>
    <p>Some scams are easy to spot, while others are so sneaky you may not know you have been scammed until <br> it’s too late. <br>
        <br>

        Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. <br>
        <br>
        
        Almost everyone will be the target of a scam at some time. You may have already been scammed. <br>
        <br>

        Most scams need you to do something before they can work. <br>
        <br>
        
        Scammers may get you to do any of the following: <br>
        <br>
        
        1.send money based on false promises <br>
        <br>
        2.give out your personal details <br>
        <br>
        3.agree to deals without getting advice <br>
        <br>
        4.buy a product without checking it properly. <br></p>

    <h1>Ten most common types of scams</h1> <br>
    <h1>1.Advance fee fraud</h1>
    <p> A scammer requests fees upfront or personal information in return for goods, services, money or rewards <br> 
        that they never supply. <br>
<br>
        Scammers invent convincing and seemingly genuine reasons for requesting payment, such as to cover fees or <br>
        taxes. <br>
        <br>
        They often ask for payment by international wire transfer. <br>
        
        These scams are commonly mass-marketed with scammers sending them out to thousands of people all over <br>
         the world at the same time, usually by mail or email. </p> 

         <br>
     
     <h1>2.Lottery, sweepstakes and competition scams</h1><br>   
    <p>An email, letter or text message from an overseas lottery or sweepstakes company arrives from out of <br>
        nowhere. <br>
<br>
        It says you have won a lot of money or fantastic prizes in a lottery or sweepstakes competition you did not <br>
        enter. <br>
        <br>
        These scams try to trick you into giving money upfront or your personal details in order to receive the prize. <br>
        <br>
        Scammers typically claim that you need to pay fees or taxes before your winnings or prize can be released. <br>
        <br>
        
        You may also have to call or text a premium rate phone number to claim your prize. <br>
        <br>
        
        Remember you cannot win a prize if you haven’t entered.</p><br>
        <br>

        <h1>3.Computer hacking</h1>
        <p>Phishing emails are commonly used by scammers to trick you into giving them access to your computer. <br>
            <br>

            They ‘fish’ for your personal details by encouraging you to click on a link or attachment. <br>
            <br>
            
            If you click, malicious software will be installed and the hacker will have access to files and information 
            <br> stored on your computer. <br>
            <br>
            
            A phishing email often appears to come from an organisation that you know and trust, like a bank or financial <br> institution, asking you to enter your account password on a fake copy of the site’s login page. <br>
            <br>
            
            If you provide your account details, the scammer can hack into your account and take control of your profile.</p>
<br>
            <h1>5. Online shopping, classified and auction scams</h1>
            <p>Scammers like shopping online for victims. Not getting what you paid for is a common scam targeting online <br>
                 shoppers. <br> 
                <br>
                A scammer will sell a product and send a faulty or inferior quality item, or nothing at all. They may also <br> 
                pretend to sell a product just to gather your credit card or bank account details. <br> 
                <br>
                These scams can also be found on reputable online classified pages. <br>
                <br>
                
                An online auction scam involves a scammer claiming that you have a second chance to buy an item that you <br> 
                placed a bid on because the winner has pulled out. <br>
                <br>
                
                The scammer will ask you to pay outside of the auction site’s secure payment facility.
                
                If you do, your money will be lost and the auction site will not be able to help you.</p>
